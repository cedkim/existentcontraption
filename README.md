# Existent Contraption
Existent Contraption is a project to create designs from the physics simulation puzzle game Fantastic Contraption in real life. This may sound far off or ridiculous, but Fantastic Contraption is a *physics* simulation puzzle where you build machines to transport an object to an often hard-to-reach goal. Existent Contraption wants to make these machines into fun little desk toys. Since Fantastic Contraption has realistic-enough physics, many things created in-game could be made as such desk toys.
## The code
Existent Contraption will involve a program that converts FC design save data to SVG files that can be used for cutting or processed for other types of manufacturing such as 3D printing.
